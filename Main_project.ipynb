    "\n",
    "The movie industry faces high financial-performance risks because of increasingly high movie-making and marketing costs and a high degree of uncertainty about audience reactions (Escoffier et al., 2015).\n",
    "While Metacritic provides rich information about movies such as the critic scores, user scores, review texts and metadata, it is \n",
    "unclear how well these features can predict the monetary success. That's why this project uses historical data from Metacritic and movie sales information information to build several machine learning models that forecast whether a movie will result in low, medium or high sales. Furthermore, this project will focus on explaining which features drive these predictions. \n",
    "The final goal is to provide the movie publisher with valuable information on where to spend the marketing budget.\n",

    "2. How well can different machine learning models predict the sales tier of a movie, based on structured features?\n",
    "3. To what extent does adding transformers of review titles and/or movie summaries improve prediction performance compared to models using only structured features? \n",
    "4. Which features are most influential in predicting high versus low sales according to SHAP?\n",
    "5. Can we identify review topics and/or movie clusters (e.g., using BERTopic and clustering methods) that are particularly associated with high or low sales tiers, and do these insights reveal distinct market segments?"

    "### Reflection on the raw datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the first EDA, we can already see which problems exist in each table and what type of cleaning steps we need next.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### UserReviews_raw\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shape: 319,662 rows and 7 columns. This is a large table with one row per user review.\n",
    "- Important columns:  \n",
    "  - `url` links the review to a specific movie. There are no missing values here, so this is a good key.  \n",
    "  - `idvscore` is a user score, but currently comes from Excel as text with quotes. We need it as a clean numeric column.  \n",
    "  - `reviewer` contains usernames, but there are about 3,400 missing values. We do not want empty reviewer names in the final data.  \n",
    "  - `dateP` is a text date (for example `'Apr 25, 2013'`) with quotes and also has about 3,400 missing values.  \n",
    "  - `Rev` is the review text. We will mainly keep this as a text field, but we want to know where reviews are missing.  \n",
    "  - `thumbsUp` and `thumbsTot` are sometimes missing (around 3,500 rows). Later we want to create an extra variable `thumbsDown` from these.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning implications:\n",
    "- Convert `dateP` into a proper `datetime` column and keep invalid dates as `NaT`.  \n",
    "- Clean the `reviewer` column and replace missing or empty names with `\"Unknown Reviewer\"`.  \n",
    "- Convert `idvscore`, `thumbsUp` and `thumbsTot` into numeric using `get_numeric_value` and `clean_numeric_columns`.  \n",
    "- Create a new variable `thumbsDown` from `thumbsTot - thumbsUp` using `calculate_thumbs_down`.  \n",
    "- For this we use helpers like `clean_user_review_dates`, `clean_reviewer_column`, `clean_numeric_columns` and `calculate_thumbs_down`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ExpertReviews_raw\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shape: 238,973 rows and 5 columns, similar to the user reviews but without thumbs columns.  \n",
    "- Almost no missing values: only 2 missing for `idvscore`, `reviewer`, `dateP` and `Rev`.  \n",
    "- `dateP` is often `None` and must be converted to `datetime` just like in the user table.  \n",
    "- `reviewer` has a few missing values that we again want to replace with `\"Unknown Reviewer\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning implications:\n",
    "- We want the same behaviour as in `UserReviews_raw` so both tables are consistent and easier to combine later.  \n",
    "- We mainly use `clean_expert_review_dates`, `clean_reviewer_column` and `clean_numeric_columns`.  \n",
    "- We also create unique IDs for reviewers and reviews with `create_expert_ids` and `create_review_ids`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### sales_raw\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shape: 30,612 rows and 16 columns. This is our box office / financial table.  \n",
    "- A lot of missing values in `production_budget`, `opening_weekend`, `theatre_count`, `avg run per theatre` and also in the box office columns.  \n",
    "- Column `Unnamed: 8` is completely empty and can be dropped later.  \n",
    "- `release_date` is a free-form text date (for example `\"January 1st\"`) and needs to be converted to `datetime`.  \n",
    "- `international_box_office`, `domestic_box_office`, `worldwide_box_office` and `production_budget` are numeric amounts but come as text from Excel.  \n",
    "- `url` is present and has no missing values, which is useful as a link to the movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning implications:\n",
    "- Convert all monetary and count columns to numeric using `get_numeric_value` and `clean_numeric_columns`.  \n",
    "- Create one total revenue measure `total_box_office` using `calculate_total_box_office`.  \n",
    "- Convert `release_date` to a clean `releasedate` column via `clean_sales_dates`, with a fallback on `year` where needed.  \n",
    "- Drop the completely empty `Unnamed: 8` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### meta_raw\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shape: 11,364 rows and 13 columns. This is our movie-level metadata table.  \n",
    "- Important columns: `url`, `title`, `studio`, `rating`, `runtime`, `metascore`, `userscore`, `RelDate`.  \n",
    "- `url`, `title`, `metascore` and `RelDate` have no missing values, which is good for linking and modelling.  \n",
    "- Many missing values in `awards`, `summary` and `cast`. These are mainly descriptive and not strictly required for a first prediction model.  \n",
    "- `RelDate` is already in a clean date format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning implications:\n",
    "- Standardise the release date into a single `releasedate` column using `standardize_meta_dates` so it aligns with the other tables.  \n",
    "- Keep text fields like `summary`, `awards` and `cast` as they are for now, but we know they contain many missings.  \n",
    "- Treat `runtime`, `metascore` and `userscore` as important numeric features for later modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Across all tables\n",
    "\n",
    "- All tables have a `url` column, and it is never missing. This makes `url` a natural starting point for linking movies across datasets.  \n",
    "- However, URLs and titles are not always written in exactly the same way, and small spelling or formatting differences can cause duplicate or mismatched movies.  \n",
    "  Because of this, we need a separate cleaning step to standardise movie names and create a single consistent `movie_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we introduce the following helper functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `clean_movie_name` and `extract_title_from_url` to standardise movie names and extract readable titles from URLs.  \n",
    "- `collect_all_movie_records`, `create_movie_dimension_table` and `add_movie_ids_to_datasets` to build a movie dimension table (`movie_key`) with a unique `movie_id` per cleaned movie name and to merge that ID back into all datasets.  \n",
    "- `create_all_ids` to create stable IDs for users, experts and individual reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "After these cleaning steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- dates use a consistent `datetime` format across tables,  \n",
    "- numeric fields are properly numeric instead of messy text,  \n",
    "- reviewers and reviews have unique IDs,  \n",
    "- and all tables can be joined via a single `movie_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cleaned structure is then ready for feature engineering and machine learning models (for example regression or KNN) at the movie level.\n"

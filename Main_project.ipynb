    "## 0. Business problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The movie industry faces high financial-performance risks because of increasingly high movie-making and marketing costs and a high degree of uncertainty about audience reactions (Escoffier et al., 2015).\n",
    "While Metacritic provides rich information about movies such as the critic scores, user scores, review texts and metadata, it is \n",
    "unclear how well these features can predict the monetary success. That's why this project uses historical data from Metacritic and movie sales information information to build several machine learning models that forecast whether a movie will result in low, medium or high sales. Furthermore, this project will focus on explaining which features drive these predictions. \n",
    "The final goal is to provide the movie publisher with valuable information on where to spend the marketing budget.\n",

    "**Business Question** How can we predict box office perfomance of the movie to accuratly allocate marketing budget?\n",

    "How accurately can we predict a movie's first-year sales using Metacritic ratings, metadata, review texts, with particular focus on identifying the most influential predictive factors?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subquestions**\n",
    "1. How are critic scores, user scores, genres, platforms, and release years related to the sales tiers of movies?\n",
    "2. How well can different machine learning models predict the sales tier of a movie, based on structured features?\n",
    "3. To what extent does adding transformers of review titles and/or movie summaries improve prediction performance compared to models using only structured features? \n",
    "4. Which features are most influential in predicting high versus low sales according to SHAP?\n",
    "5. Can we identify review topics and/or movie clusters (e.g., using BERTopic and clustering methods) that are particularly associated with high or low sales tiers, and do these insights reveal distinct market segments?"

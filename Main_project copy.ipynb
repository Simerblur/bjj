    "The movie industry faces high financial-performance risks because of increasingly high movie-making and marketing costs and a high degree of uncertainty about audience reactions (Escoffier et al., 2015).\n",
    "While Metacritic provides rich information about movies such as the critic scores, user scores, review texts and metadata, it is \n",
    "unclear how well these features can predict the monetary success. That's why this project uses historical data from Metacritic and movie sales information information to build several machine learning models that forecast whether a movie will result in low, medium or high sales. Furthermore, this project will focus on explaining which features drive these predictions. \n",
    "The final goal is to provide the movie publisher with valuable information on where to spend the marketing budget.\n",

    "2. How well can different machine learning models predict the sales tier of a movie, based on structured features?\n",
    "3. To what extent does adding transformers of review titles and/or movie summaries improve prediction performance compared to models using only structured features? \n",
    "4. Which features are most influential in predicting high versus low sales according to SHAP?\n",
    "5. Can we identify review topics and/or movie clusters (e.g., using BERTopic and clustering methods) that are particularly associated with high or low sales tiers, and do these insights reveal distinct market segments?"

    "### Reflection on the raw datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the first EDA and the 10 variables (X1-X10) identified for this research, we can see which problems exist in each table and what cleaning steps are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Required Variables Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research focuses on 10 specific variables:\n",
    "- **X1**: Metascore (from `meta_raw`)  \n",
    "- **X2**: Userscore (from `meta_raw`)  \n",
    "- **X3**: Production Budget (from `sales_raw`)  \n",
    "- **X4**: Genre (from `meta_raw`)  \n",
    "- **X5**: Release Date (from `meta_raw` or `sales_raw`)  \n",
    "- **X6**: Runtime (from `meta_raw`)  \n",
    "- **X7**: Theatre Count (from `sales_raw`)  \n",
    "- **X8**: MPAA Rating (from `meta_raw`)  \n",
    "- **X9**: Movie Summary (from `meta_raw`)  \n",
    "- **X10**: Review Text (from `UserReviews_raw` and `ExpertReviews_raw`)  \n",
    "- **Target**: Worldwide Box Office (from `sales_raw`)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### meta_raw\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shape: 11,364 rows and 13 columns. This is our primary movie-level metadata table.  \n",
    "- **Critical columns for X1-X2, X4, X5-X6, X8-X9**:  \n",
    "  - `metascore` (X1): No missing values, already numeric. This is our primary critic rating.  \n",
    "  - `userscore` (X2): Contains some missing values, needs numeric conversion.  \n",
    "  - `genre` (X4): Contains genre information, will need One-Hot Encoding for multiple genres.  \n",
    "  - `RelDate` (X5): Already in clean date format, no missing values. Will extract month and year.  \n",
    "  - `runtime` (X6): Contains movie duration in minutes, needs numeric cleaning.  \n",
    "  - `rating` (X8): MPAA rating (G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17), categorical variable.  \n",
    "  - `summary` (X9): Plot summary text, many missing values but essential for semantic embeddings.  \n",
    "  - `url`: No missing values, serves as our primary linking key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning implications:\n",
    "- Standardise `RelDate` into a single `releasedate` column using `standardize_meta_dates`.  \n",
    "- Ensure `metascore`, `userscore` and `runtime` are properly numeric.  \n",
    "- Keep `summary` text for later transformer-based embeddings, noting missing values.  \n",
    "- Process `genre` for One-Hot Encoding.  \n",
    "- Validate `rating` contains only valid MPAA categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### sales_raw\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shape: 30,612 rows and 16 columns. This contains our target variable and X3, X5, X7.  \n",
    "- **Critical columns for X3, X5, X7 and target**:  \n",
    "  - `worldwide_box_office`: Our target variable, comes as text and needs numeric conversion.  \n",
    "  - `production_budget` (X3): Many missing values (~20,000), needs numeric conversion from text.  \n",
    "  - `theatre_count` (X7): Distribution width proxy, many missing values, needs numeric conversion.  \n",
    "  - `release_date` (X5): Free-form text date needs conversion to datetime for seasonal trends.  \n",
    "  - `url`: No missing values, used for linking to meta table.  \n",
    "- Column `Unnamed: 8` is completely empty and should be dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning implications:\n",
    "- Convert `worldwide_box_office`, `production_budget` and `theatre_count` to numeric using `get_numeric_value`.  \n",
    "- Convert `release_date` to datetime via `clean_sales_dates`, with fallback on `year` where needed.  \n",
    "- Handle missing values in budget and theatre count appropriately for modelling.  \n",
    "- Drop irrelevant columns like `Unnamed: 8`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### UserReviews_raw & ExpertReviews_raw\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combined shapes: 319,662 user reviews (7 columns) + 238,973 expert reviews (5 columns).  \n",
    "- **Critical column for X10**:  \n",
    "  - `Rev`: Review text body, essential for BERTopic modeling and identifying discourse topics.  \n",
    "  - `url`: Links reviews to specific movies for aggregation.  \n",
    "  - `dateP`: Review dates, though not in our X1-X10, useful for temporal analysis.  \n",
    "- User reviews have ~3,400 missing values in reviewer and date fields.  \n",
    "- Expert reviews have only 2 missing values across key fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning implications:\n",
    "- Primary focus: ensure `Rev` text is preserved and linked to correct movies via `url`.  \n",
    "- Convert dates to datetime format for consistency.  \n",
    "- Clean reviewer names (replace missing with \"Unknown Reviewer\").  \n",
    "- Create review IDs for tracking individual reviews.  \n",
    "- Plan to aggregate reviews at movie level or use for BERTopic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Across all tables\n",
    "\n",
    "- All tables have a `url` column with no missing values, making it our natural linking key.  \n",
    "- However, URLs may have slight variations, so we need standardisation to create a consistent `movie_id`.  \n",
    "- After cleaning, we'll have a movie-level dataset with all X1-X10 variables aligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helper functions needed:\n",
    "- `clean_movie_name` and `extract_title_from_url` to standardise movie identifiers.  \n",
    "- `collect_all_movie_records`, `create_movie_dimension_table` and `add_movie_ids_to_datasets` to create a movie dimension table.  \n",
    "- Data type conversion helpers for numeric fields (budget, scores, runtime, theatre count).  \n",
    "- Date standardisation functions for release dates across tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "After these cleaning steps, we'll have:\n",
    "- A clean movie-level dataset with all 10 predictor variables (X1-X10) and the target (Worldwide Box Office).  \n",
    "- Consistent date formats for temporal feature extraction (month, year).  \n",
    "- Properly formatted numeric and categorical variables ready for One-Hot Encoding.  \n",
    "- Review texts prepared for transformer embeddings and topic modeling.  \n",
    "- All tables linkable via `movie_id` for seamless joins.\n"
